## Business Context
One of the commercial challenges that insurance firms face in terms of accident severity is effectively forecasting the level of severity of an accident. Accurate forecasting allows insurance firms to charge clients appropriate premiums based on their accident severity. Inaccurate forecasting can result in undercharging, leading to losses for the insurance company, or overcharging, which may result in losing customers to competitors. Thus, building a credible model for predicting accident severity represents a significant revenue opportunity for an insurance firm.

## Business Objective
The accurate prediction of accident severity considering input variables such as location, vehicle type, weather conditions, and more, will provide valuable insights for insurance companies to make informed decisions on claim settlement and pricing. This will help reduce costs and increase revenue. The analysis will be carried out using a classification model since the target variable "accident severity" is categorical. Machine learning algorithms will be used to learn and evaluate the likely severity of an accident at a particular time.

## Data Description
- **Input Variables**: Location, vehicle type, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
- **Target Variable**: Accident severity (categorical).

## Modeling Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying significant variables that influence accident severity.
3. **Model Development**: Building classification models using machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Results and Analysis
- **Model Performance**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights**: Key factors influencing accident severity and their impact.
